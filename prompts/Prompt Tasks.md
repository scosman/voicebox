### About

We are working on a few unique prompt tasks. This is an incomplete set, and I expect it to grow and change.

### Prompt tasks

1. Text expansion: Expand text, allowing them to type much less, while communicating their meaning in a well formed friendly way.
2. Next sentence: provide options for the next sentence, with zero new input.
3. More like this: offer different phrasings, with a range of tone and expression. Correct any grammar or spelling issues.

### Shared prompt goals

These are shared across all prompt tasks.

1. Speaker Context: provide the model with context about the speaker, so the responses are more personal. Example: "hello" can be expanded to "Hello my name is Jeff." if it knows the speaker's name.
